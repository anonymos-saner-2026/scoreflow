Given the question described as follows: {problem}
We already have one solution as follow: 
{solution}

Now you need to evaluate this solution very carefully, then give the revised solution. When you evaluate, you need to critique this solution based on four dimensions: "Logical correctness", "Accuracy of calculation", "Potential misunderstanding of the problem", and "Level of Detail". Unless the given solution is absolutely perfect, you should rewrite the solution based on your revision and given solution.

Provide a critique for each dimension in the "thought" field, and provide the revised answer in your "revised_solution" field.
"""

ANSWER_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
